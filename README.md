faucet
=====

faucet is a pythonic integration framework

Think of it as flask for getting applications to talk to each other

Why use a framework?

 - So you spend less time writing code to transport data, serialise/deserialise, manage messaging semantics, and
 can spend more time building features.

 - Less time testing and validating framework and plumbing code

 - Clear structure and pathway to implement features
